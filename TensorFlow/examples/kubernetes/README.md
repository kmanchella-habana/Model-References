# Kubernetes Example File
Kubernetes provides an efficient and manageable way to orchestrate deep learning
workloads at scale.

This folder contains a sample .yaml file for training a ResNet 50 Keras model on
a Kubernetes deployment on Gaudi.   This file is an addendum to the examples
provided in the [Kubernetes user
guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Gaudi_Kubernetes/Gaudi_Kubernetes.html).
It shows a full example implemented on a bare metal configuration.   Please
refer to this document for more information.
